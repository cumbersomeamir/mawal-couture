# Visual verification report — first pass

Date: 2026-01-29

Summary:
- Automated DOM snapshots captured for both the target site (tulpalav.com) and the local clone (Mawal Couture). Screenshot attempts timed out intermittently; will retry.

Pages & features checked (first pass)
- Homepage: implemented (hero, featured collections, new arrivals) — Needs imagery and fine typographic tuning.
- Header / Navigation: basic structure implemented; added Woman/Man/Pashmina/Craft links. Target site has deep nested menus — not yet implemented.
- Products listing: implemented with filters bar and grid.
- Product detail: implemented with image gallery placeholders, size selector and add-to-cart action.
- Cart sidebar: implemented and persisted to localStorage.
- Sign-in / Sign-up modals: implemented (mock).
- About/Contact/Checkout: basic pages implemented (placeholders).
- Woman/Man collection pages: scaffolds created.
- Footer: multi-column footer implemented.

Missing / TODO (priority)
- Replace placeholders with high-quality royalty-free images (hero + product images).
- Implement nested mega-menu for Woman/Man categories to match target.
- Exact font files: need permission or provide files to precisely match.
- Pixel tuning: spacing, font sizes, and color shades to match target site exactly.
- Implement CMS-like product data and additional pages (projects, booking).
- Retry and capture full-page screenshots across breakpoints for visual diffing.

Next steps
1. Swap placeholder images for selected stock assets.
2. Implement mega-menu and deeper navigation.
3. Iteratively tune typography & colors, run screenshot comparisons, and adjust until parity.
